# Etch-a-Sketch

This is a project to practice manipulation of the DOM almost entirely through JavaScript. The goal should be to create an Etch-a-Sketch style program, where a user can select a grid size, color in the space by moving their mouse over it, and to be able to reset the grid at any moment.
